Moebi is a basic demo e-commerce web app selling furniture. Users can registrate, login, logout and edit their own profiles. Users receive a nice HTML Mail at registration and (demo-)purchase. of a product. Products are divided into categories. Users can find a product easily by the fixed search form. An Admin role authorises the adding of products and articles. I have written Unit Test and functional Test for all models and most controllers. This app was my main project during my web development course on Careerfoundry. I added many extras, like the responsive frontpage with dynamic loaded content, cloud image uploading, automatic image resizing, product categories and an article model.
